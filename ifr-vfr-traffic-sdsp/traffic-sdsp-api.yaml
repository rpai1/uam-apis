  title: Live IFR/VFR Flights Traffic SDSP for NASA UAM X3
  version: "0.0.3-draft"
  description: |
    The following document describes the available **Socket.IO** events for the Live Traffic SDSP as part of the NASA UAM X3 engineering evaluation.

    ### Disclaimer

    * As of writing, Async API does not capture the nuances of Socket.IO such as Events and Emits. This document should **only** be used for implementation reference and code-generation of objects data models.
    * 'Events' in Socket.IO are represented in Async API as 'Channels'.
    * 'SUB' or 'subscribe' in Async API denotes a Socket.IO Client receiving those events, if explicitly listened for.
    * 'PUB' or 'publish' in Async API denotes a Socket.IO Client emitting those events.

    timestamp:
      description: >-
        Timestamps MUST follow the guidance set forth in RFC3339.
        This RFC defines a profile for ISO8601 focused on interoperability of Internet
        based systems.  This profile makes certain design decisions based on
        reducing rarely used options, elimination of redundant information, and
        overall simplicity.

        From these goals and insight from building interoperable systems,
        RFC3339 provides a grammar for timestamps.  Please see

        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6

        for that grammar and the sections preceding that grammar for more
        detailed discussion.

        For UTM, we have attempted to reduce the grammar to a regular expression,
        but this does not take into account all rules.  For example, a valid
        timestamp should not allow 30 days in February, but this is not in the
        regular expression.  Likewise, leap years are not captured in the
        regular expression.  Thus it is possible for a timestamp to satisfy this
        RE, but still not be valid and, thus, be rejected by some components of
        UTM.

        Note that this UTM format specifies millisecond precision for all
        time stamps.  This is why the min and max length are fixed at 24.

        Note that this UTM format specifies UTC time indicated by a trailing 'Z'.

        Note that this UTM format specifies date and time separation with a 'T'.
